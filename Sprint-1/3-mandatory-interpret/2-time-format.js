let movieLength = 8784; // length of movie in seconds

// For the piece of code above, read the code and then answer the following questions


// a) How many variable declarations are there in this program?
// there is 6 variable declaration

// b) How many function calls are there?
// there is only the log() call

// c) Using documentation, explain what the expression movieLength % 60 represents
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators
// the logic is to calculate the movieLength remainder - operator returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second operand. 
// It always takes the sign of the dividend.

// d) Interpret line 4, what does the expression assigned to totalMinutes mean?
// to calculate the movie length into minutes

// e) What do you think the variable result represents? Can you think of a better name for this variable?
// the result represent the movie length - hours minutes and second in a string - movieTime

// f) Try experimenting with different values of movieLength. Will this code work for all values of movieLength? Explain your answer
// Yes - the above logic calculates the movie length in hours minutes and seconds
